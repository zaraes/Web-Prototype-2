          <p>WIRES have large numbers of dedicated licensed volunteers, working around NSW, to rescue and care for tens of thousands of animals every year. WIRES is licenced for wildlife rescue and care by NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and is subject to comply with all NPWS policies and licence conditions.

          To become a volunteer with WIRES you need to complete WIRES Rescue and Immediate Care Course (RICC). Completing the initial RICC training enables you to rescue a range of sick, injured and orphaned native animals. When you start as a rescuer, you will normally take rescued animals to a vet or experienced carer for assessment immediately after the rescue. You may also regularly be picking animals up from vets to transport them to a carer. 

          The rescue and care of species such as koalas, snakes and bats requires the completion of additional specialist courses.</p>

        <div class="Carer">
          <p>Having pets and/or young children and being a wildlife carer are not mutually exclusive. However, wildlife in care needs to be kept away from all people (unnecessary contact with carers as well) and pets to minimise stress on the animals and improve their chances of survival when they are released.

          It is illegal to take native animals from the wild and keep them as pets. Wildlife that come to WIRES only stay in care until they can be released back into the wild. When wildlife is in care itâ€™s our duty to always act in the best interest of the animal. Unnecessary contact with wild animals can induce stress and impede their ability to be successfully released back into their natural environment and carry out natural behaviours such as finding food and avoiding predators, such as domestic pets.</p>
